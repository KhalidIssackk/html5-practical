WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Welcome to our HTML5 media demonstration.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This video includes captions using a WebVTT track.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Captions improve accessibility for all users.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
They help people who are deaf or hard of hearing.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
They also benefit users in noisy environments.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
HTML5 makes adding captions simple and standard.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Thank you for watching this demonstration!
